The PhlatScripT is a set of tools in the form of a plugin for Google
SketchUp. It allows for assigning of CNC cut/fold/drill/mill, etc.
functions to SketchUp designs as a full featured CAM solution. It was
designed for use with the Phlatboyz easy to assemble and learn CNC
machine kits. For more information about these affordable Kits, please
visit <a href="http://www.phlatstore.com/">
Phlatboyz Machines</a> 
<br><br>
The vision and direction of the PhlatScripT is Mark and Trish Carew's
of Phlatboyz, LLC and is released under GLN licensing terms. Since this
code and the ideas behind it is a collaborative effort among many
people, it can not be sold in any form. For more information, please
contact Mark and Trish Carew through www.phlatboyz.com or
kram2422@comcast.net. It has come to fruition through the help of many
volunteer programmers, testers, and users. We want to thank everyone
for your efforts put forth to make this a reality. The PhlatScripT is
an ever changing and evolving program. <br><br><i>This is a great project and if you would like to contribute your time and talents to help the Phlatscript grow, please <a href="mailto:kram2422@comcast.net">contact us</a></i>
			
			</div>
			<div class="intro">
Since the PhlatScripT is released as open source, anyone and everyone
is welcome to download it and experiment with it. The ultimate goal is
to create a complete and powerful CAM solution directly within SketchUp
capable of outputting 3D tool paths and possibly in the future will be
the ability to not only output the g-code but control the Phlatprinter
as well :) Have fun and please let us know how you are using the
Phlatscript www.Phlatforum.com </div>
			<div class="intro"> The PhlatScripT or any form of this
code can not be used for commercial gain or sold in any form. This code
is a volunteer collaboration project that consist of the efforts of
many people. We are keeping this truly open source. <br><b>Please send questions or comments to </b><a href="mailto:kram2422@comcast.net">Phlatboyz,LLC</a>

Enter <b>Phlatboyz Parameters</b> to set: [spindle speed, feed rate, plunge rate, safe travel,
material thickness, bit diameter, tab width, tab depth factor, the safe
cutting area size and comment text] which will appear in
the generated g-code. All g-code output uses the safe cutting
area's local origin(the bottom left corner) and only
edges within the safe cutting area will generate g-code. This will
allow designs requiring multiple sheets to be contained within one
SketchUp file and the cut codes processed as one sheet at a time for
separate g-code files for each sheet.  The safe area is assumed to be 
at sketchup's origin, unless placed elsewhere using the Safe Area Tool.<br><br> 
    
    Also, there are 2 check boxes for additional options: <br>
1) "<u>multipass</u>" - for cutting hard materials, where you want to limit the depth of cut
by cutting multiple thin layers. <br>  
2) "<u>Overhead Gantry</u>".  The original 2
phlatprinters cut from the bottom. Use this option if you have a Phlatprinter3 or your 
cnc machine has an overhead gantry.  This will reverse the direction of the Inside and Outside cuts.<br><br>

<u>Note</u>: When you press "OK", these settings will be saved as attributes to your
sketchup model.  So each sketchup file will retain their individual settings.</td>

			<td class="command-description">
<b>Inside Cut Tool</b> - This tool is used to cut out openings.  It is 
assigned to a closed loop of edges and requires a corresponding face.  The cut path is offset to the inside, 
to compensate for the material removed by the cutter. The face will change 
to a transparent texture to resemble a hole. It differs from the outside cut
tool in that the path cut direction, will be counter-clockwise.<br><br>

Use the<u>["Shift" key]</u> if the preview shows the inside cut on the wrong side. Just press and
hold "Shift" prior to clicking.								 <br><br>

Use the <u>["End" key]</u> if the tool locks onto the wrong adjacent face.  You won't need this feature, if you
 hover over faces instead of edges.                                      &nbsp; <br><br>

				Note: reversing the face (Edit/Face/Reverse Faces) <i>prior</i>
to using the Inside Cut Tool will cause the cut direction to be
reversed. In milling, the rotation of the bit, counter clockwise or
clockwise, determines which edge of the design will be left rough.
Normally, in SketchUp, you would leave the default grey side
facing up for all faces, before you assign cut lines. Otherwise, if the
face is reversed (white), and a cut line is assigned whether
inside or outside, the rough edge will be on the part and not the waste. So, in
short, make sure that the grey side is facing up and the PhlatScripT
will cut your part file in the right direction leaving a nice clean
edge on the part. </td>

<b>Outside Cut Tool</b> - This tool is used to cut the outside contour
of your part. It is assigned to a closed loop of edges and requires a corresponding face. 
The cut path is offset to the outside, to compensate for the material removed by the cutter. 
The thin face between the original line and the Outside Cut line will get a transparent texture. 
It differs from the inside cut tool in that the path cut direction, will be clockwise.
<br>
<br> 
Use the<u>["Shift" key]</u> if the preview shows the outside cut on the wrong side. Just press and

<b>Tab Tool</b> - 
				This tool is used to place tabs along any inside or outside cut Phlatboyz edge.
				The tabs hold the parts in place while the media (foam sheet, balsa, cardboard, etc.) moves back and forth in the machine.
				<br><br>
				This tool uses the tab width and tab depth factors which are defined in the Parameters dialog. 
				Use that dialog to define the tab tool parameters prior to using the tool; 
				changing the values in the Parameters dialog will not affect tabs that have already been placed.
<br><br>
Use the <u>["End" key]</u>, to toggle from standard Tabs to V-Tabs.  V describes the angled tabs vs the standard rectangular tabs.  
The cursor will change from a T to V to show the current mode.
<br><br>
Use the <u>["Home" key]</u>, to toggle Bold Tab viewing mode off/on.  When the tab tool is active, this feature makes 
the tabs easy to see.  Turn it off, if sketchup slows down when using the tab tool.  
<br><br>
Note:
A feature of the Tab Tool is the ability to 'draw' tabs to any width
you desire always starting with the default width. For example, if the
tabs placed along a curve are too small, you can hold the left mouse
button down and draw then in wider. The tab depth will remain the same
as defined in the parameters dialogue.                    
<br><br>
Note:
The tab tool has click/drag functionality, for multiple tabs or extending tab width.                 &nbsp; </td>

			<td class="command-description">
<b>Fold Tool</b> - 
				This tool is used to define a fold line.  The use of a fold line is 
                to create a crease, so a sheet of foam can be folded or bent to form 3d shapes.  Or by using 
                a series of stepped depth fold lines, create a hinge line for a model airplane control surface.
				<br><br>
				It automatically selects a single edge.  Press the <u>["Shift" key]</u>, if you want all connected edges.
				<br><br>        
				Use the <u>["End" key]</u> to toggle between short and wide mode.  When hovering over an edge, the short 
                mode shows a pink color preview.  Wide mode shows a darker red/purple preview color.  Short and Wide mode
                 status is also shown on the bottom status text.  
				The default short mode will shorten both ends of the edge by a small amount.  
                The main reason is to break contact and stop the possible creation of an extra face and loop, 
                which could confuse the phlatscript.  Wide mode will act normally 
                and not offer this protection.  But you can use wide mode, if say you want a connected chain of edges.
				
				<br><br>
				Use the <u>["Left Arrow"]["Right Arrow"]</u> keys to scroll through the preset depths: [25%, 50%, 75% & 100%]. 
				This will result in the cut depth, as a percentage of the material thickness.
				You can see the current depth factor in the VCB (lower right hand corner in SketchUp). <br>
        Use the <u>["Down" key]</u> to set the depth back to the default of 50%.
				<br><br>Note:  You can type custom depth values into the VCB, using your keyboard.  The value is not excepted, until the "Enter" key
is pressed.  Then the % suffix will appear with the VCB value, which indicates the value is now set.  Max value allowed is 140%.

<b>Plunge Tool</b> - 
				This tool is used to create a plunge point at any given cursor position.  The use of the plunge tool is to drill holes.
				<br><br>
				The plunge tool creates a circle with a brown radius line extending from the center to the outside diameter.
				The diameter of the circle is determined by the Phlatboyz "Bit Diameter" parameter.
				<br><br>
				The plunge tool allows the generation of gcode required to plunge the bit at the depth indicated 
				in the "Material Thickness" Parameters dialog.

<b>Center line Tool</b> - 
				This tool is used to define a center line cut on a SketchUp edge. 
				The common use of center lines, is to cut a shallow graphical design or slot.  
                If you are able to draw the necessary pattern of lines to form a pocket, you can also use center lines to cut out the pocket.  Pocket milling  
                is when you cut out shallow openings, that doesn't penetrate to the other side.
                <br><br>
				It automatically selects all connected edges.  Press the <u>["Shift" key]</u>, if you only want a single edge.

				<br><br>
                Default is to erase all types of Phlatedges. This is the cursor that has
no letters next to it. 
<br><br>
Use the <u>["Left Arrow"]["Right Arrow"]</u> keys, if you want to erase only one type of edge.  It will cycle through
and show in the VCB(lower right hand corner of
SketchUp) which line type is currently assigned to the eraser. Also, each type has it's own unique cursor.<br>
Use the <u>["Down" key]</u> to quickly go back to the default "erase All types".
<br><br> 
Tab highlighting has been added to the eraser tool: <br>
Use the <u>["Home" key]</u>, to toggle Bold Tab viewing mode off/on.  When the eraser tool is active, this feature makes 
the tabs easy to see.  Turn it off, if sketchup slows down when using the eraser tool. 
<br><br> 
Note: The right click context menu will also allow you to erase ALL selected Phlatboyz edges.
